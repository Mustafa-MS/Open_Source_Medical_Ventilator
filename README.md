# Open_Source_Medical_Ventilator
This repository for design an open source medical ventilator

This is a simple sketch for an open source ventilator, this ventilator works only on air, the air source can be from air compressor or the hospital central gas system, or any source that can supply about 2 bar pressure, and 20-40 L/min flow)
🔴If someone is interested in doing this, he must buy the items with the specifications listed below⬇️:
▪️1. Air inlet (this should follow the standards medical gas female connector BS EN ISO 5359:2014+A:2017)
this can be neglected if we use direct connected air compressor.

▪️2. Inlet filter with water trap.
▪️3. High pressure transducer, 4 bar
▪️4. Check valve (stainless steel)
▪️5. Non relief Pressure regulator
▪️6. Flow valve ( normally closed, max flow 100 l/min)
▪️7. Inhalation + Exhalation Digital Flow sensor
▪️8. Safety relief valve (80 cm H2o)
▪️9. Inhalation + exhalation digital pressure sensor 
▪️10. Exhalation solenoid valve
These items should be reliable, cheap, and available.

*There will be another design that use O2 and Air.
