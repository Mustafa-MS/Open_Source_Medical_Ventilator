# Open_Source_Medical_Ventilator
This repository for design an open source medical ventilator

This is a simple sketch for an open source ventilator, there are two designs, first for air only, and the second for air + O2.
the air and O2 source can be from air compressor or the hospital central gas system, or any source that can supply about (4 bar pressure,
and 20-40 L/min flow)

If someone is interested in doing this, he must buy the items with the specifications listed below:
1. Air inlet (this should follow the standards medical gas female connector BS EN ISO 5359:2014+A:2017)
this can be neglected if we use direct connected air compressor.
2. Inlet filter with water trap.
3. High pressure transducer, 4 bar
4. Check valve (stainless steel)
5. Non relief Pressure regulator
6. Flow valve ( normally closed, max flow 100 l/min)
7. Inhalation + Exhalation Digital Flow sensor
8. Safety relief valve (80 cm H2o)
9. Inhalation + exhalation digital pressure sensor 
10. Exhalation solenoid valve
These items should be reliable, cheap, and available.
